## PBOTuner2

#### 1. Install PBO Tuner
If you do not already have [PBO2tuner](https://www.overclock.net/threads/corecycler-tool-for-testing-curve-optimizer-settings.1777398/page-45#post-28999750) you can choose to install it with the script

**Note:** the script will search for the pbo2tuner exe on your C drive if you do not choose to install it with the script


#### 2. Apply Undervolt
The script will get your number of cores and display a text box for each type - then 1-30 or use the common values 

**Not Recommended** you can also apply custom power limits (ppt tdc edc)

Once you apply the script will create a scheduled task to run pbo2tuner at startup with your undervolt settings
